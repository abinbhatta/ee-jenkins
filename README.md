# Jenkins Container
This is a repository to create a custom container with my UCP certificates

INSTRUCTIONS TO CONFIGURE JENKINS ARE IN THE WIKI


## Prepare DTR
Login into DTR and create yourself a repo to push the image into. After this login to the client

```
docker login https://52.56.228.3/
```

## Build the image and push to DTR

```
docker build -t 52.56.228.3/admin/jenkins:latest .
docker push 52.56.228.3/admin/jenkins:latest
```

UNSURE IF Required. Enter the Docker EE Reg Credentials on the Pipeline Model Definition.

UNSURE IF REQIURED. Enter your credentials on the Git Plugin.

Create a new Cloud using the Yet another Docker Plugin. And test connectoin :)
![Alt text](/images/NewCloudConfig.jpg?raw=true "New Cloud Config")

On the Docker Template. Add your image name. 

On the Docker Create Container settings, we need to give the container persmissions to use Docker in Docker (DIND).
Under Volumes: /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock and tick the run as privileged container tick box.

Hopefully you are then good to go :)
